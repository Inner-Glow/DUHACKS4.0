#Why We Built This
Students often miss exciting campus events because information is scattered across WhatsApp groups, posters, and word of mouth. Organizers, on the other hand, struggle with manual registrations and security at entry points.
This platform solves both problems by creating a centralized, digital solution for students and organizers alike.


 Key Features
1. Easy Event Discovery
No more endless scrolling through chat groups! Find all college events in one single, organized platform.

2. Fully Responsive Design
Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop ‚Äì access it anytime, anywhere.

3. Seamless One-Click Registration
No lengthy forms. Register instantly with just one click!

4. Digital Ticketing with QR Codes
Forget paper tickets! Students receive a QR-coded digital pass that can be scanned at the venue for quick entry.

5. Reduced Manual Work for Organizers
Event organizers can automate registrations & verification, saving hours of effort.

6. Better Security & Verification
The QR code-based entry system ensures only registered participants get access, preventing unauthorized entries.


üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

Frontend: Designed with a modern, responsive UI for an intuitive user experience.

Authentication: Secure login system to ensure verified student access.

Storage: Due to budget constraints, instead of a traditional database, we cleverly utilized JSON files as a lightweight storage solution, mimicking database-like behavior.

Performance: Despite using multiple technologies, we optimized components to ensure smooth performance without compromising speed.

üåü What Makes It Special?

Budget-Friendly Yet Powerful ‚Äì Built entirely from scratch without expensive infrastructure.
Tech-First Approach ‚Äì Even with limited resources, we implemented authentication, QR verification, and event management seamlessly.
Made for Students, by Students ‚Äì Designed with the real college experience in mind.

üéØ The Impact

‚úî Students can easily find, register, and attend events without hassle.
‚úî Organizers save time with automated processes.
‚úî Events become more secure, structured, and accessible.
